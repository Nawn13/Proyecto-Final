                Welcome to our website, I am Sergi Estrella Amat. One of the creators and
                designers of this website and right now I live in Spain - Barcelona.
                Until now I have completed an intermediate cycle of microcomputer systems in
                network and right now I am finishing the second year of higher education. I'm
                taking this cycle with the idea of ​​doing a master's degree and a doctorate
                intensive with the mentality of finishing in one or two years while doing some
                I work part-time preferably in a company dedicated to the sector
                web or cybersecurity sector.
                I am taking these cycles partly motivated by my former teachers
                in addition to personal tastes in this sector. Personally I have the idea of
                work for a few years in companies and then see if I prefer to work
                freelance or enter as a university professor. My preference is usually
                set towards the security sector.
                Since I am a person who likes to be busy, I think that shifts
                tomorrow are the most suitable for me since I don't like the idea of ​​having
                all morning without work, at the moment I have not had any work
                by contract therefore I am willing to try various positions within
                of a company as long as it does not involve spending all day attending to
                people external to the company itself.
                Although perhaps in this short text it cannot be seen, I am a person
                orderly who likes to apply what she has learned to anything, so and a
                constant and dedicated person to work, I am even usually good at dividing
                jobs if doing it together with a team. I am an easy person to
                know and I always try to give support to the people I live with.
                With that said, I conclude my portfolio about myself. I hope and enjoy the page.

                Welcome to our website im David Fernández González and i ride in Barcelona im
                doing a courses of one superior professional training of network systems administration and
                cybersecurity. Previously I coursed one middle professional training of network systems administration and
                cybersecurity and one PFI of assembly assistant and maintenance of
                administration system. My plans for next year are to finish my studies and
                continue studying a master's degree while working on something related to my
                studies I currently do not have a preference on what I would like to work on
                In the future I am open to being able to learn about all areas. I am a person
                who has no problems when working as a team, arriving on time and being
                responsible with my team and my work. I am a person who does not give up
                at first and tries everything he can and always plans the times of his
                jobs and moments of leisure, who has no problem talking to someone who doesn't
                be part of your team and who is eager to learn and take advantage of opportunities
                give him for it. My hobbies are video games, rap and anime. something that
                What makes it different is that I always try to put myself in other people's shoes to
                know what they are going through.

                Hello! I am Pau Paús Torres, I am 20 years old and I live in Barcelona. I am passionate about computing and my
                journey includes studies in SMIX, a year of DAW, and I am currently studying
                ASIX with a focus on cybersecurity.
                Once the current course ends, I intend to continue studying. I am undecided between
                focus on a master's degree in cybersecurity specialized in forensics or delve into the world
                of artificial intelligence.
                Since I was little, computing has been a fundamental part of my life, inspired by my
                older brother who also chose this path. My desire is to work in computer forensics or
                artificial intelligence, areas that I consider exciting. However, I am willing to
                explore other branches of computing.
                I consider myself a reliable person and I stand out for my ability to work as a team and
                help others. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, while
                I keep up to date with the latest news in the world of artificial intelligence and
                cybersecurity.
